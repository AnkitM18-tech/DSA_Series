int x=5 ;  ----> variable
int* p ; -----> pointer
p = &x ; ----> p stores address of x
int &y = x ; ----> reference variable --> y represents x --> y++ will increase x.
Reference means address
Reference variable is an internal pointer
Declaration of reference variable is preceded with & symbol( do not read address of). must be initialized during declaration.
can be initialized with already declared variables only.
can not be updated reference variables. unlike pointers, which can be updated. reference variables will internally point to the variable with which it is initialized.(represent)

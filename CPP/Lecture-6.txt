Structure is a collection of dissimilar elements. Way to group variables. Used to create data type.

struct book {
	int book_id;
	char title[20];
	float price;
	void input() {
		cout << ;
		cin >> book_id >> title >> price;
	}
	void display() {
		cout << "\n" << book_id << â€¦ ;
	}
}b3;  -->Global
		Both are valid
book b2; --> Global 

void main() {
	book b1 = {100, "Howdy!",450.0}; --> local variable
	book b2,b3;
	b2.book_id = 101;
	strcpy(b2.title,"Howdy Returns"); --> to assign string value to char array
	b2.price = 451.0; 
	b3 = b2;  --> this is also possible direct copy
}

C++ structs can contain functions too. we can access those using . operator .

We can use access modifiers public, private and protected in structures to decide which members can be accessed by whom.

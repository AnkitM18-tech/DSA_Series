In C standard o/p method --> printf() --> predefined function.
In C++ standard way --> cout --> predefined object. << --> insertion/put to operator.
Likewise for input it's cin --> >> --->extraction/get to operator.
ANSI standards for C++ language says explicit declaration of function is compulsory. Header files only contains declaration in header files but definition is present in library files.
Predefined functions are declared in header files, so whenever using any predefined functions , have to include specific header file that contains its declaration. endl is a manipulator works as "\n" with flush operation slower than "\n".

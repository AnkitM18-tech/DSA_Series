creator : Bjarne Stroustrup - 1979 - C with classes - 1983 - C++ named - Simula67 1st OOPs Language.
C++ mid level language.Both low level and high level programming can be done using C++.
3 separate programming traditions : procedural like C , object oriented and generic supported by C++ templates.
C++ can use existing C software libraries. C follows top down approach of programming but C++ follows bottom up approach of programming. - means you do all detailing work and define all functionalities first and then assemble everything and decide the flow of program. main function is written at the end (assembling).
Any entity in the system that can be defined as a set of properties and set of operations performed using entity's property set, is knows as Object.
Encapsulation, Data Hiding, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance.
Class is a blueprint of an Object. Class is a description of object's property set and set of operations.
Object is a run time entity, not class. Class is means to achieve encapsulation. 

.cpp ---> preprocessor (connects header files content to our program) <---- header files which returns --> .i files, which contains all the content from our files and header files excluding the #include .---> compiler ----> gives .obj file (.i files are not saved anywhere but they are built in the ram) (compiler translates our .i file and create .obj file.)
.obj ---> linker <---- library files ====> .exe file which can be executed. Linker converts .obj file to .exe using library files.

A pointer contains address of an object is called Object Pointer.

type of data = type of pointer

class Box {
	private:
		int l, b, h;
	public:
		void setDimension(int x, int y, int z) {
			l=x; b=y; h=z;
		}
		void showDimension() {
			cout << l << b << h ;
		}
};

void main() {
	Box *p, smallBox;
	p = &smallBox;
	smallBox.setDimension(12,13,14); || p --> setDimension(12,10,14);
	smallBox.showDimension(); || p --> showDimension();
}

"this" is a local object pointer in every instance member function containing address of the caller object.
"this" pointer can not be modified. It is used to refer caller object in member function.

this->l = l; this->b = b; this->h = h; inside the method if the parameters and variables names are same.
